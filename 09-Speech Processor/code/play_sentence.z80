;
; This program interates through a list of Allophones and outputs them to the SP0256-AL2 chip
; Once all Allophones are sent (terminated by 0FFH, it waits for kay press, then repeats.
;
; This program is designed for the TEC (Talking Electroincis) Z80 Single board computer
; with the Speech Add-on.  The Add on is connected to Port 5 of the output decoder.
